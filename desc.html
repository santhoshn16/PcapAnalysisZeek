	<td>TPC(Total Packet Count)</td>
	<td>Total number of packets that were seen in a single connection.</td>

<tr>
	<td>SPC(Small Packet Count)</td>
	<td>Number of packets that were seen with payload less than 20 bytes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>GPC(Gap Packet Count)</td>
	<td>Number of packets that were seen in between consecutive small packets. More gap packets means less continuous small packets.</td>
</tr>

	<td>DATAEXCHANGED(B)</td>
	<td>Sum of data (in bytes) that has been seen in a single connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>RATIO(ser/cli)</td>
	<td>This is calculated based on how much data has been sent from the server divided by the amount of data sent by the client. This helps in knowing if any data exfiltration has happened or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>METRIC T()</td>
	<td>Continuous small packets show that traffic is interactive in many services like ftp, telnet, http, ssh. T is calculated based on spc-gpc-1/tpc</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>METRIC ALPHA()</td>
	<td>Machine driven connection has a tendency of sending packets continuously with short intervals(here considered 2 sec) between them. So now we can use that to remove those types of connections from the observable list. Ratio of the above statement is calculated and a threshold is set after many considerations. (More no of consecutive sp fall in range of 2 sec, closer will be the ratio to 1)</td>

	<td>CVE id in the name of pcap shows that, there is a “.NET Framework Remote Code Execution Vulnerability” which allows an attacker to execute code remotely via a malicious document or application. This was rated as a severe vulnerability. 
Infection traffic included HTTP requests for SOAP code injection, JavaScript, Powershell script, and a Windows executable over TCP port 8007.  Post-infection activity consisted of HTTP POST requests over TCP port 80. 
So, this pcap file consists of those files which can make a system vulnerable if it's not protected.</td>
